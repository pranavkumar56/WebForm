    It is low level (raw) form of data and is also human readable.
    Simplest way to retrieve data in a JSON format.
    Web-services API - Can be used with any programming language that has support for HTTP.
    It is built on top of one of the fastest and real-time data indexing engine - PowerIndeX.
